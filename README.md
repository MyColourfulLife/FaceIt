1. In order to make our custom view and it's properties can be used in StoryBoard, We can use IBDesignable before our view calss and IBInspectable before our properties.

2. There are two ways to draw a view
    - use context
    - use path
    
3. pay attention to the contentMode, you can set its value to Redraw with code or xib
